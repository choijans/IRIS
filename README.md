# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Module

This branch contains the **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** functionality for the system.  
It ensures that users can only access features and data relevant to their assigned roles, helping to maintain privacy and prevent unauthorized access.

## Features

- **User Role Definitions (v5.1)**  
  - Define and manage system roles such as:
    - **System Administrator**
    - **IT Personnel**
    - **Faculty**

- **Access Control**  
  - Restricts system functionalities based on role.
  - Provides a clear separation of responsibilities.
  - Enhances security and compliance.

## Purpose

The RBAC module improves security by limiting access to sensitive system functions.  
By assigning roles, organizations can enforce **least privilege** principles, ensuring users have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
