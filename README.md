System Administrator View
The Software Management page allows IT Personnel to deploy approved software applications to selected laboratory PCs. They can choose which applications to install and which machines to target, making the process of keeping labs updated efficient and organized.

When reviewing a specific application, a pop-up window shows which PCs currently have the software installed. This provides IT Personnel with a quick audit of software distribution across the laboratory environment.

IT Personnel can also remove outdated or unauthorized software from selected PCs using this section. The interface supports bulk uninstallation, ensuring laboratory machines remain compliant and optimized for performance.

The Policy Enforcement View lets administrators configure and activate key policies across lab PCs, such as resetting wallpaper on startup, access control restrictions, and auto-shutdown after 30 minutes of inactivity, ensuring consistent system behavior and compliance with guidelines.

Within the Policy Enforcement section, administrators can select which specific laboratories should have the configured policies applied. This allows flexibility to adjust settings according to the unique needs or rules of each lab room.

Within the Access Logs page, administrators can view the activities of the users of the application. They also have the ability to search and filter the logs based on the user name, roles, as well as dates.
